    <p>BococaCampFinder is a web app that helps you find the perfect summer camp for your child in the BoCoCa Neighborhoods of Brooklyn and surrounding areas. BococaCampFinder was created after talking with fellow mom friends and realizing the lack of a central place to find all the summer camps within their neighborhood.</p>
